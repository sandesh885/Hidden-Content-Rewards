## Project Description
The **Hidden Content Rewards** smart contract allows game developers to reward players with tokens for discovering hidden content, such as Easter eggs, secret areas, or unique in-game items. Players who discover these hidden contents can claim a reward once per discovery, and the claim is tracked and recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and fairness. The contract is designed to be easily integrated with an ERC-20 token, enabling decentralized rewards for players. This promotes deeper engagement in games and rewards players for exploring and interacting with the game world.

## Project Vision
The vision for the **Hidden Content Rewards** project is to create an engaging, rewarding experience for players in the gaming ecosystem by leveraging blockchain technology. By rewarding players for discovering hidden content within games, we aim to:
- Increase player exploration and engagement in games.
- Promote fairness and transparency by recording rewards on the blockchain.
- Provide game developers with a decentralized reward system that enhances player satisfaction.
- Encourage a thriving gaming community through rewarding secret discoveries and hidden challenges.

## Key Features
- **Token Rewards**: Players can earn tokens for discovering hidden content in the game world.
- **Claim Tracking**: Players can only claim a reward once per hidden discovery, preventing abuse.
- **Customizable Rewards**: The reward amount can be set and modified by the contract owner (typically the game developer).
- **Event Logging**: When a reward is claimed, an event is emitted to log the claim, allowing for transparent tracking and record-keeping.
- **Token Withdrawal**: The contract owner can withdraw tokens from the contract balance.
- **Security**: Only the contract owner has access to critical functions such as setting rewards and withdrawing tokens, ensuring proper control and security.

## Future Enhancements
- **Discovery Verification**: Implement a more advanced discovery verification system (e.g., game state verification) to automate the process.
- **Leaderboard**: Create a leaderboard to track top players who discover the most hidden content.
- **Off-chain Game Logic**: Integrate the smart contract with off-chain game logic for a seamless user experience.
